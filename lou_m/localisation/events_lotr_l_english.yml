 LOU_RACE_BUFFS: "Our strength and heritage shall make the entire Middle Earth tremble!"
 
 LOU_races.1.t: "Human"
 LOU_races.1.d: "The race of Men is the second race of beings created by the supreme God, Ilúvatar. Men bear the Gift of Men, which is mortality, and therefore they age and die when their time comes, and are susceptible to illness and disease."
 LOU_races.1.a: "Understood!"

 LOU_races.2.t: "Dwarves"
 LOU_races.2.d: "Dwarves were a race in Middle-earth also called Khazad, the Naugrim, meaning Stunted People, and Gonnhirrim, meaning Masters of Stone.  .Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than hobbits but much broader and heavier. Most Dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts."
 LOU_races.2.a: "Understood!"

 LOU_races.3.t: "Dragon"

 LOU_races.5.t: "Ents"
 LOU_races.5.d: "Ents, called Onodrim (Tree-host) by the elves, are a very old race that appeared in Middle-earth at the same time that the elves did. Ents were envisioned as Shepherds of the Huorns, to protect the forests from orcs and other perils. The Elves have tales of teaching the trees and the Ents to talk: although the Ents were sentient beings at the time, they did not know how to speak until the Elves taught them."
 LOU_races.5.a: "Understood!"
 
 LOU_races.6.t: "Eru's Children"
 LOU_races.6.d: "The Great Eagles were beings of Arda said to have been 'devised' by Manwë Súlimo, leader of the Valar, and were often called the Eagles of Manwë.

 LOU_races.7.a: "Understood!"
 
 LOU_races.8.t: "Giant"
 LOU_races.8.d: "The origins of Giants are unknown, as is the exact time they first appeared in Middle-earth; however, it seems that they entered the history of the peoples of Middle-earth in the Third Age.

 LOU_races.8.a: "Understood!"
 
 LOU_races.9.t: "Spiders"
 LOU_races.9.d: "The Great Spiders, also known as the Spawn of Ungoliant, were a race of oversized and sentient arachnids that lived in Middle-Earth, particularly in dark and perilous places affected by the power of the Shadow.

 LOU_races.9.a: "Understood!"
 
 LOU_races.10.t: "Half Dwarf"
 LOU_races.10.d: "A mysterious people about whom little was known - they shared characteristics of both dwarves and men, suggesting an ancient union between the two races; indeed, they have been called 'half-dwarves'. The Umli dwelt in the cold North of Middle-Earth, to the East of the Forodwaith. Like the Men called Forodwaith, the Umli are masters of the Far North. They live in the woods and highlands to the east of the Forodwaith, in the bitterly cold regions of North-Central Middle-Earth, The Umli remain in these wilds year-round, residing in caves and braving the terrible frosts of the dark winter. Unlike Mannish folk, they can withstand the coolest temperatures and thrive in the icy gales that sweep southward off the Encircling Sea. The Umli range far out across the realms others call wastes, and they subsist by hunting, fishing, and gathering- They are unparalled foragers. Subsisting on edible plants that others might never even see, the Umli utilize virtually every gift offered by the land."
 LOU_races.10.a: "Understood!"
 
 LOU_races.11.t: "Hobbits"
 LOU_races.11.d: "Hobbits, also known as Halflings, were an ancient mortal race.

Most of their race eventually founded the land of the Shire in about the year TA 1601, though a type of Hobbit called Stoor still live in the Anduin Vale (the type of Hobbit Sméagol was, or was related to)."
 LOU_races.11.a: "Understood!"

 LOU_races.12.t: "Half Orc"
 LOU_races.12.d: "The origin and nature of the half-orcs is unknown. Back in the First Age, Men could under the domination of Morgoth or his agents be reduced to a savage stage, and it was possible to mate with Orcs, producing stronger and larger Orcs, or vile and cunning Men. Half-Orcs were half-bloods of Orcish and Mannish descent. Some Half-Orcs appeared rather mannish, although usually ugly and sallow-faced, some appeared as horrible creatures with the bodies of men and goblin-heads."

Wise Elves of Eressëa believed that Melkor had created the orcs before the First Age by breeding Elves he had captured and corrupted, by means of torture and mutilation."
 LOU_races.13.a: "Understood!"

 LOU_races.14.t: "Trolls"

They are significantly more muscular and not quite so bow-legged as Orcs, and often stood six feet tall, notably larger than Orcs but still shorter than most men."

 LOU_races.16.t: "Istari"
 LOU_races.16.d: "The Wizards, initially known as the Istari, were five Maiar spirits sent to Middle-earth as human forms to aid the Free Peoples against the threat of Sauron.

Saruman became a naked spirit and wandered Middle-earth forever, due to his banishment from Valinor. Radagast remained in Middle-earth, tending to the wilderness. The fate of the Blue Wizards is unknown."

Both Steward Beren of Gondor and the King of Rohan are relieved at this offer and eagerly accept - turning the Key of Orthanc over to Saruman. In T.A. 2759 the valley in which Isengard resided soon became known as 'Nan Curunír', the 'Valley of Saruman' or the 'Wizard's Vale'. Optimistic locals are pouring into the area to open trade routes, help with construction, and provide investments for expansion. A formal 'Guard of Orthanc' has been established and is recruiting champions from Dunland, Adornland and Rohan to fill its ranks. The Elves of Rivendell and Lothlorien have also invited the Istari to join the White Council, attaching their interests to his.

Not only did we lose last Autumn's final harvest, but many food stores were exhausted with the five-month Winter we've endured. Worse, the massive amount of snowfall has begun melting and the resulting floods are destroying our fields and natural crops. The difficulties with spring-planting will again mean much lower crop yields. Wild game are becoming sparse looking for their own food to eat and livestock are starving from not enough feed. The region is now battling widespread food shortages that threaten life, trade, production, manpower, and overall availability of supplies. Rapidly rising food prices are beginning to cause inflation. Hobbits are starting to starve, and a general outcry has begun. Our Shirriffs have established some degree of autonomy to help mitigate problems locally on their own. Gandalf is moving about the region doing what he can to help, but even he is just one simple old wizard. We estimate it will take roughly one year to stabilize our trade, repair fields, replant crops, and import extra provisions from nearby Bree and Lindon.

Mercenary from Bree and even a few Dunedain captains have offered to join our militias until our numbers recuperate as well. Furthermore, rumor is that Gandalf will be sticking around for a while - some say he is overtly fond of our pipeweed.
