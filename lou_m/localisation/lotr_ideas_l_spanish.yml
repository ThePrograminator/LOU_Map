 waring_tribes_desc: "Many say the Haradim only banded together due to the fact Sauron was slowly regaining power, and were fearful of Sauron if they continued to war against one another. This was mainly due to Sauron seeing the Harad's as his men and did not want a dimished army due to in-fighting. ."
 grip_of_sauron_desc: "The grip of Sauron was growing ever stronger, the Haradim no longer felt human but one with the armies of Sauron. The people of harad would follow Sauron forever to defeat Gondor. This led to a great deal of warriors dying and a great deal of hiring Mercenaries begone."

 covering_a_continent_desc: "Rhûn is a diverse land that borders many known and unknown lands and dominions, the most of any in Middle-earth. It is so large that it could almost be called its own continent."
 many_cultures_desc: "Rhûn was the domain of the Easterlings, Men of Darkness who were ready to follow both the Dark Lords and fought as their allies in war. These lands, too, were inhabited by lost Elves, Avari and Úmanyar, and by four of the seven clans of the Dwarves."
 copper_mines_desc: "Near the western slopes of the Orocarni were volcanic vents that continually spewed mineral rich ore-rocks, forming great hills of rich piles of ores. These ores was made to every soldier of Rhûn who was scrumptiously clad in lustrous scale armor. Their next-best match was the forces of Gondor, an ancient kingdom attempting to recreate its noble Númenórean heritage harking back to the days of Isildur and Elendil."
 expanding_the_army_desc: "The need of a larger army to supply Saruon's armies with new units became a problem for Rhûn. The need to recruit new armies from the populace."
 noble_lords_desc: "Ulfang and his sons were secretly in the employ of Morgoth, and betrayed the Eldar and Edain during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in what is now known as the Treachery of Men. Forever the men of Rhûn would be ruled by their lords to be intruments of Darkness"
 trading_all_kinds_desc: "The massive, fertile fields near the Sea of Rhûn could have easily both fed the civilians at home and the army abroad on campaign. The warm, humid climate and rich soil would provide a wonderful arena where food and textile crops could flourish all year round. Crops like tropical grains, greens, winemaking grapes, succulent melons and tubers could provide the Rhûnic populace with a wide variety of delectable options and culinary recipes, as well as being the luxurious rarities desired by the rest of Middle-earth."
 rhunic_war_traditions_desc: "This was proven in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The Easterlings' resolve to fight to the death was also exemplified the next day, when the tables turned against Sauron. While the host of Mordor dropped their weapons, shed their armor, and fled en masse across the bridge to Osgiliath, the host of the Easterlings halted with their backs to the River Anduin and stood their ground. None survived, despite inflicting numerous casualties upon their hated enemies."
