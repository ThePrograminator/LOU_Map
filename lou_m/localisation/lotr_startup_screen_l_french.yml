The city of §YMinas Tirith§! remained the capital of §YGondor§! for the rest of the §YThird§! Age and into years of the §YFourth Age§!.\n§YGondor§! was at the height of its power in its early years due to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed. However, continued attacks by allies of §YSauron§!, civil war, and a devastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the §YThird Age§!.\n\n§YGondor§! might be in a decline but all is not lost yet. You are the strongest nation military and economically, until Sauron reveals himself... To secure §YGondor§! and the men of the west, you must reconquere lost teritory like; §YAndrast§!, §YHarnendor§! or §YRhovanion§! to be strong enough to repel the evil of §YMordor§!!"

However, §YGandalf§! later went to Dol Guldur himself and discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. He then informed the White Council, and Saruman was unable to protest. The White Council attacked Dol Guldur, and Sauron, not yet powerful enough to challenge them, fled to §YMordor§!. \n\n As Dol Guldur, we must make sure to not be discovered by The White Council and use this time to let Sauron gather his strength for the upcoming battle. §YTasks§! are needed to be done before this can happend."
