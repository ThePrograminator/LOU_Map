The city of §YMinas Tirith§! remained the capital of §YGondor§! for the rest of the §YThird§! Age and into years of the §YFourth Age§!.\n§YGondor§! was at the height of its power in its early years due to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed. However, continued attacks by allies of §YSauron§!, civil war, and a devastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the §YThird Age§!.\n\n§YGondor§! might be in a decline but all is not lost yet. You are the strongest nation military and economically, until Sauron reveals himself... To secure §YGondor§! and the men of the west, you must reconquere lost teritory like; §YAndrast§!, §YHarnendor§! or §YRhovanion§! to be strong enough to repel the evil of §YMordor§!!"

Dol Guldur was built on the hill known as §YAmon Lanc§!. §YThe White Council§! long feared the power in Dol Guldur might be Sauron, but §YSaruman§! opposed assaulting it. However, §YGandalf§! later went to Dol Guldur himself and discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. He then informed the White Council, and Saruman was unable to protest. The White Council attacked Dol Guldur, and Sauron, not yet powerful enough to challenge them, fled to §YMordor§!. \n\n As Dol Guldur, we must make sure to not be discovered by The White Council and use this time to let Sauron gather his strength for the upcoming battle. §YTasks§! are needed to be done before this can happend."

But the §YDúnedain of Arno§!, were diminished and of the §YMen of Eriador§! there remained now too few to people the land or maintain the cities and castles in the region. Many of Dúnedain of Arnor had died in the War of the Last Alliance and the §YDisaster of the Gladden Fields§!.\nAfter the reign of §YEärendur§!, the seventh king that followed Valandil, the Dúnedain of Arnor became divided into petty realms and lordships, and the evil realm of §YAngmar§! destroyed them one by one.\nIn the year §Y2758 of the Third Age§!, The Dúnedain of Arnor are stretched across the region into smaller pockets, and they are divided on leadership amongst different Chiefdoms.\n\nThe first task is to build up your strength, as you need to prepare for the battles ahead. §YRivendell§! will be your closest ally, and if we help secure some of their lands in §YEregion§!, then they will hand over defence of §YEriador§! to you.\n\nTo the northeast, lies the once lesser kingdom §YRhudaur§!, a large area of forest, hills, and rivers. The lands are infested with §YTrolls, Orcs and Hillmen§! who are in service of Angmar. Your task will be to rid these lands of their dangers and regain contact and allegiance with the lost §YDúnedain Tribe of Carandor§!.\n\nTo the northwest lies the region of §YArthedain§! and the once great capital of Arnor, Annúminas. To reclaim our old title and status we must once again take control of these lands.

Once a large portion of the Dúnedain population lived here, now bands of Orcs roam the plains, and our once great cities are haunted by §YWight spirits§!. It is essential to secure the rivers of the §YBrandywine and Greyflood§!, so that trade can flow between our lands and §YThe Great Kingdoms of Gondor and Rohan§!.\n\nOnce Eriador has been secured and we once again can restore the Kingdom of Arnor, we should turn our attention north, to the frozen lands of Angmar, and once and for all destroy our old fow."
